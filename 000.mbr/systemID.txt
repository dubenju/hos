Below a list of the known partition IDs (system indicators) of the various operating systems, file systems, boot managers, etc. For the various systems, short descriptions are given, in the cases where I have some info. There seem to be two other major such lists: Ralf Brown's (see interrupt list under Int 19) and Hale Landis' but the present one is more correct and more complete. (However, these two URLs are a valuable source for other information.) See also the old Powerquest table and the specification for DOS-type partition tables.

ID Name
00 Empty
To be precise: this is not used to designate unused area on the disk, but marks an unused partition table entry. (All other fields should be zero as well.) Unused area is not designated. Plan9 assumes that it can use everything not claimed for other systems in the partition table.

01 DOS 12-bit FAT
DOS is a family of single-user operating systems for PCs. 86-DOS (`QDOS' - Quick and Dirty OS) was a CP/M-like operating system written by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (1979). Microsoft bought it, renamed it to MS-DOS 1.0 and sold it to IBM (1980) to be delivered together with the first IBM PCs (1981). MS-DOS 2.0 (1983) was rather different, and designed to be somewhat Unix-like. It supported a hard disk (up to 16MB; up to 32MB for version 2.1). Version 3.3+ added the concept of partitions, where each partition is at most 32MB. (Compaq DOS 3.31 relaxed this restriction.) Since version 4.0 partitions can be 512 MB. Version 5.0 supports partitions up to 2 GB. Several clones exist: DR-DOS (from Digital Research, later part of Novell and called NovellDOS or NDOS, then owned by Caldera and called OpenDOS, then by its subsidiary Lineo who named it back to DR-DOS. See http://www.drdos.com/), PC-DOS (from IBM), FreeDOS, ... See Types of DOS. See comp.os.msdos.* and MSDOS partitioning summary. The type 01 is for partitions smaller than 16 MB.

02 XENIX root
03 XENIX /usr
Xenix is an old port of Unix V7. Microsoft Xenix OS was announced August 1980, a portable and commercial version of the Unix operating system for the Intel 8086, Zilog Z8000, Motorola M68000 and Digital Equipment PDP-11. Microsoft introduces XENIX 3.0 in April 1983. ( Timeline of Microcomputers) SCO delivered its first Xenix for 8088/8086 in 1983. See comp.unix.xenix.sco.

04 DOS 3.0+ 16-bit FAT (up to 32M)
Matthias Paul writes: Some old DOS versions have had a bug which requires this partition to be located in the 1st physical 32 MB of the hard disk, hence for compatibility with these old issues, partitions located elsewhere should better be assigned the ID FAT16B (06h).

05 DOS 3.3+ Extended Partition
Supports at most 8.4 GB disks: with type 05 DOS/Windows will not use the extended BIOS call, even if it is available. See type 0f below. Using type 05 for extended partitions beyond 8 GB may lead to data corruption with MSDOS.

An extended partition is a box containing a linked list of logical partitions. This chain (linked list) can have arbitrary length, but some FDISK versions refuse to make more logical partitions than there are drive letters available (e.g. MS-DOS LASTDRIVE=26 is good for at most 24 disk partitions; Novell DOS 7+ allows LASTDRIVE=32).

06 DOS 3.31+ 16-bit FAT (over 32M)
Partitions, or at least the FAT16 filesystems created on them, are at most 2 GB for DOS and Windows 95/98 (at most 65536 clusters, each at most 32 KB). Windows NT can create up to 4 GB FAT16 filesystems (using 64 KB clusters), but these cause problems for DOS and Windows 95/98. Note that VFAT is 16-bit FAT with long filenames; FAT32 is a different filesystem.

07 OS/2 IFS (e.g., HPFS)
IFS = Installable File System. The best known example is HPFS. OS/2 will only look at partitions with ID 7 for any installed IFS (that's why the EXT2.IFS packet includes a special "Linux partition filter" device driver to fool OS/2 into thinking Linux partitions have ID 07). (Kai Henningsen (kai@khms.westfalen.de))

07 Windows NT NTFS
Filesystem introduced in Windows NT 3.1. It is rumoured that the Windows NT boot partition must be primary, and within the first 2 GB of the disk.

07 exFAT
Extended FAT, a.k.a. FAT64. Available in Microsoft Windows since CE 6.0 and Vista SP1. Allows 32 MB clusters and very large disks and files.

09 AIX data partition
Some reports interchange AIX boot & data. AIX is IBM's version of Unix. See comp.unix.aix.

09 Coherent filesystem
Coherent was a UNIX-type OS for the 286-386-486, marketed by Mark Williams Company led by Bob Swartz, renowned for its good documentation. It was introduced in 1980 and died 1 Feb 1995. The last versions are V3.2 for 286-386-486 and V4.0 (May 1992, using protected mode) for 386-486 only. It sold for $99 a copy, and the FAQ says that 40000 copies have been sold. See comp.os.coherent and this page. A Coherent partition has to be primary.

0a OS/2 Boot Manager
OS/2 is the operating system designed by Microsoft and IBM to be the successor of MS-DOS. Dropped by Microsoft. See comp.os.os2. Windows 2000 actively tries to destroy OS/2 Boot Manager. See below.

0e WIN95: DOS 16-bit FAT, LBA-mapped
0f WIN95: Extended partition, LBA-mapped
Windows 95 uses 0e and 0f as the extended-INT13 equivalents of 06 and 05. For the problems this causes, see Possible data loss with LBA and INT13 extensions. (Especially when going back and forth between MSDOS and Windows 95, strange things may happen with a type 0e or 0f partition.) Windows NT does not recognize the four W95 types 0b, 0c, 0e, 0f ( Win95 Partition Types Not Recognized by Windows NT). DRDOS 7.03 does not support this type (but DRDOS 7.04 does).

10 OPUS (?)
Maybe decimal, for type 0a.

11 Hidden DOS 12-bit FAT
When it boots a DOS partition, OS/2 Boot Manager will hide all primary DOS partitions except the one that is booted, by changing its ID: 01, 04, 06 becomes 11, 14, 16. Also 07 becomes 17.

11 Leading Edge DOS 3.x logically sectored FAT
(According to Matthias Paul.)

12 Configuration/diagnostics partition
ID 12 (decimal 18) is used by Compaq for their configuration utility partition. It is a FAT-compatible partition (about 6 MB) that boots into their utilities, and can be added to a LILO menu as if it were MS-DOS. (David C. Niemi) Stephen Collins reports a 12 MB partition with ID 12 on a Compaq 7330T. Tigran A. Aivazian reports a 40 MB partition with ID 12 on a 64 MB Compaq Proliant 1600. ID 12 is used by the Compaq Contura to denote its hibernation partition. (dan@fch.wimsey.bc.ca)

NCR has used ID 0x12 MS-DOS partitions for diagnostics and firmware support on their WorldMark systems since the mid-90s. DataLight's ROM-DOS has replaced MS-DOS on more recent systems. Partition sizes were once 72M (MS-DOS) but are now 40M (ROM-DOS).

Intel has begun offering ROM-DOS based "Service Partition" support on many OEM systems. This support initially used ID 0x98 but has recently changed to ID 0x12. Intel provides their own support for this partition in the form of a System Resource CD. Partition size has remained constant at 40M. See e.g. sds2.pdf. (Chuck Rouillard)

IBM also uses 0x12 for its Rescue and Recovery partition on Thinkpad laptops. See also thinkwiki.org.

14 Hidden DOS 16-bit FAT <32M
(Ralf Brown's interrupt list adds: `ID 14 resulted from using Novell DOS 7.0 FDISK to delete Linux Native partition')

14 AST DOS with logically sectored FAT
AST MS-DOS 3.x was an OEM version supporting 8 instead of the usual 4 partition entries in the MBR. These special MBRs can be detected by another signature in the MBR stored in front of the partition table.

16 Hidden DOS 16-bit FAT >=32M
17 Hidden IFS (e.g., HPFS)

2a AtheOS File System (AFS)
AtheOS is an open source operating system written by Kurt Skauen. It is dead now - for a single page, see www.atheos.cx or sourceforge. For the history, see wikipedia. When progress seemed to stop, the project forked and the Syllable OS was started by Kristian van der Vliet (2002). See also wikipedia. It uses the same filesystem, AthFS or AFS, an extension of BeFS, the filesystem of BeOS. There is an attempt at a Linux driver at sourceforge.

39 Plan 9 partition
Plan 9 is an operating system developed at Bell Labs for many architectures. Source is available. See comp.os.plan9. Originally Plan 9 used an unallocated portion at the end of the disk. Plan 9 3rd edition uses partitions of type 0x39, subdivided into subpartitions described in the Plan 9 partition table in the second sector of the partition.

39 THEOS ver 4 spanned partition
3a THEOS ver 4 4gb partition
3b THEOS ver 4 extended partition
THEOS is a multiuser multitasking OS for PCs founded by Timothy Williams in 1983. Current release 4.0, previous release 3.2. They say about themselves: `THEOS with over 150,000 customers and over 1,000,000 users around the world brings a mainframe look and feel to computers without the complexity and high maintenance costs. Hundreds of applications exist with networking and Windows integration.' See the Theos home page

3c PartitionMagic recovery partition
Cody Batt (codyb@powerquest.com) writes: When a PowerQuest product like PartitionMagic or Drive Image makes changes to the disk, it first changes the type flag to 0x3C so that the OS won't try to modify it etc. At the end of the process, it gets changed back to what it was at first. So, the only time you should see a 0x3C type flag is if the process was interrupted somehow (power outage, user reboot etc). If you change it back manually with a partition table editor or something then most of the time everything is okay.

40 PICK
Ross Stell writes: The PICK multi-user operating system, developed in 1965 by Don Nelson and Dick Pick to run on an IBM 360 mainframe and implemented during the 1970s by many licensee companies on their minicomputers, was ported in 1983 by PICK Systems (http://www.marcomguy.com/pdf/CORP.PDF) to operate on the IBM PC-XT and later the AT and compatible PCs. This release is known as R83. Later (1989), PICK Systems produced Advanced PICK (AP) which operates within a Windows environment, thus obviating the need for a dedicated hard disk partition. See also Wikipedia.

41 Linux/MINIX (sharing disk with DRDOS)
Very old FAQs recommended to use 41 etc instead of 81 etc on a disk shared with DRDOS because DRDOS allegedly disregards the high order bit of the partition type. (Or, rather, uses the high order bit to indicate that the partition is secured.) These types are not used anymore today. Roger Wolff (R.E.Wolff@BitWizard.nl) confirms: I remember installing DRDOS, and getting a few extra drive letters that I didn't expect. Turns out those are my Minix partitions. It is looking at them as a FAT filesystem. Looks like a big mess. After finding no other possibility than to just "not touch those drive letters" I continue with the install. After a few minutes DRDOS automatically decides to write a copy of the FAT into a file on one of my MINIX partitions. Bye bye Minix partition.

42 Windows 2000 dynamic extended partition marker
If a partition table entry of type 0x42 is present in the legacy partition table, then W2K ignores the legacy partition table and uses a proprietary partition table and a proprietary partitioning scheme (LDM or DDM). As the Microsoft KnowledgeBase writes: Pure dynamic disks (those not containing any hard-linked partitions) have only a single partition table entry (type 42) to define the entire disk. Dynamic disks store their volume configuration in a database located in a 1-MB private region at the end of each dynamic disk.

Netware 286 was for an Intel 80286 and existed in various versions that were later merged to Netware 2.2. Netware 386 was a rewrite in C for the Intel 386, later renamed 3.x - it existed at least in versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. Its successor Netware 4.xx had versions 4.00, 4.01, 4.02, 4.10, 4.11. Then came Intranetware.) Netware >= 3.0 uses one partition per drive. It allocates logical Volumes inside these partitions. The volumes can be split over several drives. The filesystem used is called "Turbo FAT"; it only very vaguely resembles the DOS FAT file system. (Kai Henningsen (kai@khms.westfalen.de))

9e ForthOS partition
ForthOS is the name Andy Valencia uses for his Forth operating system, a port of eForth. Also the older VSTA by the same author uses partition type 0x9e (158).

9f BSD/OS
Current sysid for BSDI. The types b7 and b8 given below are for an older version of the filesystem used in pre-v3.0 versions of the OS. These days the system is v4.1 BSD/OS. BSDI reports 2.1 million installed servers and 12 million licenses sold. See http://www.bsdi.com/.

a0 Laptop hibernation partition
Reported for various laptops like IBM Thinkpad, Phoenix NoteBIOS, Toshiba under names like zero-volt suspend partition, suspend-to-disk partition, save-to-disk partition, power-management partition, hibernation partition. Usually at the start or end of the disk area. (This is also the number used by Sony on the VAIO. Recent VAIOs can also hibernate to a file in the filesystem, the choice being made from the BIOS setup screen.)

a1 Laptop hibernation partition
Reportedly used as "Save-to-Disk" partition on a NEC 6000H notebook. Types a0 and a1 are used on systems with Phoenix BIOS; the Phoenix PHDISK utility is used with these.

a5 BSD/386, 386BSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD
386BSD is a Unix-like operating system, a port of 4.3BSD Net/2 to the PC done by Bill Jolitz around 1991. When Jolitz seemed to stop development, an updated version was called FreeBSD (1992). The outcome of a Novell vs. UCB law suit was that Net/2 contained AT&T code, and hence was not free, but that 4.4BSD-Lite was free. After that, FreeBSD and NetBSD were restructured, and FreeBSD 2.0 and NetBSD 1.0 are based on 4.4BSD-Lite. FreeBSD runs on PCs. See http://www.freebsd.org/FreeBSD.html. For NetBSD, see below - it changed partition type to a9. 386BSD seems to be dead now. The kernel source is being published - see Operating System Source Code Secrets by Bill and Lynne Jolitz. See comp.os.386bsd.*. See http://www.paranoia.com/~vax/boot.html for NetBSD boot and partitioning info.

a6 OpenBSD
OpenBSD, led by Theo de Raadt, split off from NetBSD. It tries to emphasize on security. See http://www.openbsd.org/.

a8 Mac OS-X
Apple's OS-X ( Darwin Intel) uses this type for its filesystem partition (a UFS file system, in NeXT flavour, only differing from the *BSD formats in the first 8 KB). See also type ab.

a9 NetBSD
NetBSD is one of the children of *BSD (see above). It runs on PCs and a variety of other hardware. Since 19-Feb-98 NetBSD uses a9 instead of a5. See http://www.netbsd.org/. It is freely obtainable - see http://www.netbsd.org/Sites/net.html.

b8 BSDI BSD/386 swap partition
BSDI (Berkeley Software Design, Inc.) was founded by former CSRG (UCB Computer Systems Research Group) members. Their operating system, based on Net/2, was called BSD/386. After the USL (Unix System Laboratories, Inc./Novell Corp.) vs. BSDI lawsuit, new releases were based on BSD4.4-Lite. Now they are announcing BSD/OS V2.0.1. This is an operating for PCs (386 and up), boasting 3000 customers. (That was long ago. The current partition id is 9f, see above.)

bb Boot Wizard hidden
(PTS) BootWizard 4.0 and its new version Acronis OS Selector 5.0 use this id (i) when hiding partitions with types other than 01, 04, 06, 07, 0b, 0c, 0e, and (ii) when creating a partition without file system. See www.PhysTechSoft.com. The boot software was purchased on 2001-01-05 by SWsoft. See www.acronis.com.

c4 DRDOS/secured (FAT-16, < 32M)
c5 DRDOS/secured (extended)
This ID may also be used in obscure trickery: on a shared MS-DOS / DR-DOS machine with DR-DOS 6.0-7.03 (so that the DR_DOS does not understand type 0f and the MS-DOS does not understand type c5) one may have two extended partitions, where each operating system sees only one.

c6 DRDOS/secured (FAT-16, >= 32M)
DR-DOS 6.0 and higher (NetWare PalmDOS 1.0, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02+) will add 0xc0 to the partition type for a LOGIN.EXE-secured partition (so that people cannot avoid the password check by booting from an MS-DOS floppy). Otherwise it seems that the types c1, c4, c5, c6 and d1, d4, d5, d6 are used precisely like 01, 04, 05, 06 (but are accepted only when booting from disk).

c6 Windows NT corrupted FAT16 volume/stripe set
NTFS will add 0xc0 to the partition type for disabled parts of a Fault Tolerant set. Thus, one gets types c6, c7. See also Windows NT Boot Process and Hard Disk Constraints and Switching from DR-DOS 6.0 to MS-DOS 5.0.

c7 Windows NT corrupted NTFS volume/stripe set

Mark Morgan Lloyd (markMLl.in@telemetry.co.uk) writes: Windows NT Disk Administrator marks hidden partitions (i.e. present but not to be accessed) as type 0xfe. A primary partition of this type is also used by IBM to hold an image of the "Reference Diskettes" on many of their machines, particularly newer PS/2 systems (at a rough guess, anything built after about 1994). This clash can cause major confusion and grief if running NT on IBM kit. When this Reference Partition is activated, it changes its type into 1 (FAT12) and hides all other partitions by adding 0x10 to the type.
